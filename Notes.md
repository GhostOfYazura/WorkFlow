### Software Questions

> Is there a library for Raspberry Pi 4 to easily access the GPIO connection? In C++
>>*Yes, there is something called wiringPi that has the option to use BASH or C++ commands depending on usage.
>>This is kind of interesting because I could have a script that's running and when it's running it turns on a green >>light but when it's finish a yellow or red light is turned on.
>>http://wiringpi.com/reference/ *


> !~Can I compile this from my desktop environment?

> Can I configure a docker environment without having my Pi setup?

>!~ I am looking at 2 days of untested code.

> Should I look at coding my own?
>> Probably not because we have access to a reasonable library and while I could develop something like this. It doesn't serve a purpose that I would need it too serve.

> Is there a signal from the OS which I can interface with?

> Do I need any of that to create a basic outline & test?

> What libraries will I need?

> How versitile should the code be?

### Physical Hardware Questions

> How many volts & amps does my lights take?

> How many volts & amps does the motor I have take?

> Do I need to shift their levels?

> How can I get the OS on the board?

> Can I repurpose one of my other OS's?

> How do I calculate the voltage needed?

> How do I switch between on and off hardware wise? 

### How can I performance test this?

> Will the load be remotely close enough to show any signs of a load?

> Will there be a potential performance difference?

> How will I visualize the performance / graphs?



### Interesting but unrelated (Aka, will never look into unless work is like, HEY! THIS THING)
