1. Start off with making the repo on Github
2. Assing the tasks in Jira
    - Make a like... Quick few pops to show they exist.
3. Write out the diagram with some voice over
4. Ask myself some more questions
    - Reference the questions I asked while making the diagram.
    - Make a note, that I'm always collecting questions 
        - and then maybe thinking a little about them while I'm thinking of the question but normally putting to the side.
5. Answer enough questions to start making a prototype.
    - Which questions can't I answer?
